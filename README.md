# <Password-Generator-Challenge>

## Description

This was a code assignment utilizing a provided HTML, CSS,and Script.js to make a website reactively generate a random password for the user.

-The motivation for this project was attempting to utilize my knowledge of javascript to successfully have the website generate a random password after receiving the user's parameters.

-I built this project as a way to really test and push myself on the material we learned over the week, it was very difficult and I wasn't very successful but I still am proud of myself for being able to push myself and get farther than I thought I could.

-This project solves the page's inability to gain the user's parameters and generate a random password utilizing the given parameters.

-I learned how to better utilize arrays and functions in javascript to make a webpage reactive and to take in user's inputs and return a given request.
